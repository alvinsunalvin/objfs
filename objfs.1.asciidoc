NAME
----
objfs - object storage file system

SYNOPSIS
--------
`objfs [-options] command args...`
{blank}

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `objfs` program implements the ``object storage file system''. It exposes
objects from an object storage, such as a cloud drive, etc. as files in a file
system that is fully integrated with the operating system. Programs that run
on the operating system are able to access these files as if they are stored
in a local "drive" (perhaps with some delay due to network operations).

Currently supported operating systems are: Windows, macOS, and Linux.

GENERAL OPTIONS
---------------
The following options apply to all commands:

`-credentials path`::
    Authentication/authorization credentials to use when accessing the object
    storage. The `path` can be a file path (`/file/path`) or pointing into the
    system keyring `keyring:service/user`. The default credentials are read
    from the system keyring (`keyring:objfs/<storage>`).

`-storage name`::
    Storage name to access. The default is "onedrive".

`-storage_uri uri`::
    Storage uri to access. The default is based on the storage used.

`-v`::
    Verbose output.

COMMANDS
--------
The following commands may be used:

`help [command]`::
    Display command line help.

`auth output-credentials`::
    Perform authentication/authorization. The credentials specified in the
    `-credentials path` option will be used as the initial authentication/
    authorization credentials. In some cases the user may have to confirm
    authorization via the system web browser or other method. The resulting
    credentials will be stored in `output-credentials`.
